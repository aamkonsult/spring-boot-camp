# Spring Boot Actuator

[Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html) is a sub-project of the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project.  It includes a number of additional features that help us monitor and manage our application using HTTP and JMX endpoints.

The _Contact Us_ application needs to be production ready.  This means that that our application needs to work well in a container environment and also provide useful statistical information.  We can leverage Spring Boot actuator project to make our application production ready.
