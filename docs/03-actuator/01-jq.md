# jq
{: .no_toc }

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is a command line tool that parses and formats [JSON](https://www.json.org/) strings.  This tool can do more than just formatting and is quite useful when working with JSON responses.

## Working with JSON responses

We can interact with a REST endpoint using the `curl` command.  Say for example we need to retrieve the list of astronauts currently in space.  We can use the following endpoint to do just that.

```bash
$ curl "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json"
```

The above command will print the JSON response as a one-line string.

```json
{"message": "success", "number": 5, "people": [{"craft": "ISS", "name": "Chris Cassidy"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Anatoly Ivanishin"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Ivan Vagner"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Doug Hurley"}, {"craft": "ISS", "name": "Bob Behnken"}]}
```

This is hard to read, especially with large responses.

We can use `jq`, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor, to format the JSON received as shown next.

```bash
$ curl "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json" | jq .
```

The same response is now formatted, making easier to read.

```json
{
  "message": "success",
  "number": 5,
  "people": [
    {
      "craft": "ISS",
      "name": "Chris Cassidy"
    },
    {
      "craft": "ISS",
      "name": "Anatoly Ivanishin"
    },
    {
      "craft": "ISS",
      "name": "Ivan Vagner"
    },
    {
      "craft": "ISS",
      "name": "Doug Hurley"
    },
    {
      "craft": "ISS",
      "name": "Bob Behnken"
    }
  ]
}
```

We can retrieve the astronaut names using `jq`, as shown next.

```bash
$ curl "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json" | jq '.people | .[] | .name'
```

This will produce the astronauts' names.

```
"Chris Cassidy"
"Anatoly Ivanishin"
"Ivan Vagner"
"Doug Hurley"
"Bob Behnken"
```

`jq` [supports more filters](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters) than the one shown above.
