## Spring and spring boot

[Spring](https://spring.io/) is the most popular Java framework to date.  Released in [October 2002]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework), Spring gained popularity due to its simplicity.  Alternative technologies, such as [Java EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition), were quite complicated and required lots of boiler plate code.  Furthermore, these alternative technologies were hard to test as they relied on the application server.  It was not easy to test the application without spinning up the application server itself.

The Spring [comprise several projects](https://spring.io/projects), such as [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) or [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) to name just two.  The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) is just one of the projects.
